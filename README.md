# fastai-custom-learning-notebooks
A collection of Jupyter notebooks to help newcomers understand FastAI, hyperparameters, and more.

## Notebooks available
- **Testing Dropout Rates (small images)** - fully annotated results for comparing dropout rates from 0 to 0.9 (0 - 90% dropout).
- *Testing Dropout Rates (large images)* - no additional notes but a demonstration of how **loss** is a more useful chart on larger images (and how it takes notably longer).
