# fastai-custom-learning-notebooks
A collection of Jupyter notebooks to help newcomers understand FastAI, hyperparameters, and more.

## Notebooks available
### Dropout Rates - [Blog Post](https://mariolurig.com/coding/machine-learning/testing-dropout-rates-machine-learning-fastai)
- **[Testing Dropout Rates (small images)](https://github.com/ucffool/fastai-custom-learning-notebooks/blob/master/Testing%20Dropout%20Rates%20(small%20images).ipynb)** - fully annotated results for comparing dropout rates from 0 to 0.9 (0 - 90% dropout).
- *[Testing Dropout Rates (large images)](https://github.com/ucffool/fastai-custom-learning-notebooks/blob/master/Testing%20Dropout%20Rates%20(larger%20images).ipynb)* - no additional notes but a demonstration of how **loss** is a more useful chart on larger images (and how it takes notably longer).
- *[Testing Dropout Rates (specific layers)](https://github.com/ucffool/fastai-custom-learning-notebooks/blob/master/Testing%20Dropout%20Rates%20(specific%20layers).ipynb)* - no additional notes but a notebook exploring dropout in different layers.
